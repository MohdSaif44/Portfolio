    "description": "Programmed a robot to represent Malaysia in ABU ROBOCON 2025. Developed control software to navigate a game field, interact with game objects, and execute mission-critical tasks under tight timing constraints. Integrated distance sensors (Lasers, encoders, and LiDAR) for real-time localization and obstacle awareness. Thus improving the robot's position accuracy by 50%.",
